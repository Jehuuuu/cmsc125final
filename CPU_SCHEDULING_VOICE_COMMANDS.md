# CPU Scheduling Voice Commands Guide

## Overview
The CPU Scheduling Simulator now includes comprehensive voice command support, allowing you to control scheduling algorithms, manage processes, and control simulations hands-free using natural speech.

## How to Use Voice Commands

### Basic Format
All voice commands follow this pattern:
```
"Honey" + [command] + "please"
```

### Alternative Wake Words
- **"Honey"** (primary)
- **"Darling"** 
- **"IDE"**

### Alternative End Words
- **"Please"** (primary)
- **"Thanks"**
- **"Thank you"**

### Example Commands
```
"Honey, simulate round robin, please"
"Darling, add new process, thanks"
"Honey, start simulation, please"
```

## Available Voice Commands

### üîß Scheduling Policies
Switch between different CPU scheduling algorithms:

- **"simulate first come first serve"** - Switch to FCFS scheduling algorithm
- **"simulate shortest job first"** - Switch to SJF scheduling algorithm

### üß™ Test Scenarios
Load predefined test scenarios:

- **"load basic scenario"** - Load basic test scenario
- **"load page fault scenario"** - Load page fault heavy scenario
- **"load priority scenario"** - Load priority test scenario
- **"load round robin scenario"** - Load round robin test scenario
- **"load custom scenario"** - Load custom empty scenario

## Usage Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Enable Microphone**: Ensure browser has microphone permissions
2. **Check Compatibility**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for best results
3. **Test Commands**: Start with simple commands like "Honey, hello, please"
4. **Wait for Confirmation**: Listen for "Yes, I'm listening!" response

### Best Practices
1. **Clear Speech**: Speak clearly at normal pace
2. **Exact Phrases**: Use exact command phrases for best recognition
3. **Wait for Response**: Allow system to process before next command
4. **Quiet Environment**: Minimize background noise for better accuracy

### Scheduling Workflow
1. **Select Algorithm**: "Honey, simulate round robin, please"
2. **Add Processes**: "Honey, add new process, please"
3. **Start Simulation**: "Honey, start simulation, please"
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use pause/resume as needed
5. **Switch Algorithms**: Change anytime during simulation

### Process Management Tips
- Add processes before starting simulation for better visualization
- Use custom processes for specific test cases
- Generate random processes for stress testing
- Monitor PCB for process state changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Commands Not Recognized**: 
  - Check microphone permissions
  - Ensure exact command phrases
  - Wait for "Command mode activated" confirmation
  
- **Microphone Not Working**:
  - Refresh page and grant permissions
  - Check browser compatibility
  - Test with other voice applications

- **Simulation Not Responding**:
  - Ensure you're on the correct page
  - Check if simulation is already running
  - Try stopping and restarting simulation

### Browser Compatibility

- Ensure stable internet connection
- Keep browser updated

## Integration with Existing Features

The voice commands work seamlessly with:
- **All UI Controls**: Voice commands complement existing buttons
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Can be used alongside keyboard navigation
- **Touch Interface**: Works on touch devices with microphone
- **State Management**: Maintains consistency with manual interactions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to manual controls

## Advanced Features

### Command Chaining

```
"Honey, simulate priority, please"
[wait for confirmation]
"Honey, add new process, please"
[wait for confirmation]
"Honey, start simulation, please"
```

### Context Awareness
The system understands context:
- Simulation state (running, paused, stopped)
- Current algorithm selection
- Available processes
- Page location (Schedule vs Main vs OS Simulator)

### Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Compatible**: Works with assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Alternative**: Voice commands don't replace keyboard access
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for hearing-impaired users
- **Customizable**: Adjustable voice synthesis parameters
